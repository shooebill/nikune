# Development Workflow and Task Completion

## When a Task is Completed

Since this is a new project without established tooling, the following should be done when completing tasks:

### 1. Basic Checks
```bash
# Check Python syntax
python -m py_compile <file_name>.py

# Run the main application to test
python main.py
```

### 2. Future Setup Recommendations
As the project develops, consider adding:

#### Testing
```bash
# Install pytest
pip install pytest

# Run tests
pytest
```

#### Code Quality
```bash
# Install linting and formatting tools
pip install black flake8 isort

# Format code
black .

# Check code style
flake8 .

# Sort imports
isort .
```

#### Type Checking
```bash
# Install mypy
pip install mypy

# Type check
mypy nikune/
```

### 3. Current State
- No linting tools configured
- No testing framework set up
- No CI/CD pipeline
- No code formatting standards established

### 4. Immediate Actions After Task Completion
1. Ensure Python files have no syntax errors
2. Test basic functionality if applicable
3. Update requirements.txt if new dependencies added
4. Commit changes to git (if git repo is initialized)

### 5. Git Workflow
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
git push origin main
```

Note: This workflow should be enhanced as the project matures and proper tooling is established.
